This template uses `PLACEHOLDERS` such as `COLUMN_NAME` throughout the file names and code. Use the following list of placeholders to do a 'find and replace':

* `DESCRIPTION`: Brief description of the field type, no longer than 2 lines
* `EXTENDED_DESCRIPTION`: Extended description of the field type
* `AUTHOR_NAME`: Name of field type author
* `AUTHOR_URL`: URL to author's website
